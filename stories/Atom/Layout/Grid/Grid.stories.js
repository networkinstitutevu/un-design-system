      A grid is a series of rows where the developer specifies the content. This Design system is based on Foundation Grid, more you can find about grid system here (<a href="https://get.foundation/sites/docs/xy-grid.html">https://get.foundation/sites/docs/xy-grid.html</a>)
    </p>

    <h4>When to use:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>When the user needs to control the layout in two dimensions. With Grid users have rows and columns, cells, and grid areas (a group of more than one cell) and items must be placed in these cells or Grid areas</li>
